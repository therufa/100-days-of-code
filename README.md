# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 12, February 20, 2023

**Today's progress**
- I created a todo app with solid
- experimented a bit with typescript

**Thoughts**: the dev experience with solid is nice, but it's not at the
level of react yet, but it's nicer than Qwik. I guess I'll have to make 
a website with it :D

### Day 11, February 19, 2023

**Today's progress**:
- today I failed, RTFM


### Day 10, February 18, 2023

**Today's progress**:
- I restructured my note taking project
- I've learned a lot about next.js and next auth

**Thoughts**: This one hour thing is quite pressuring, and bulding stuff
just for the sake of making isn't really cutting it. I need to plan ahead

### Day 9: February 15, 2023

**Today's progress**:
- I started working on a text editor which uses an array of so called blocks 
where each block would contain some actual payload as well as metadata 
describing that particular block.
- then I've found slate, and replaced it with that. Slate is a text editor, 
which uses a similar internal structure and has wider adotption. me gusta

**Thoughts**: It's fine to bin stuff for something better. It's not for 
pride. Worth to mention, I learned something about TypeScript I wouldn't 
have otherwise, so it's a big W IMHO

### Day 8: February 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
- I've experimented with react refs and contenteditable
- created a htmleditable component to to format content of notes

**Thoughts**: Today I learned, that I did know nothing about the `useRef` 
hook, but now I do. Niiice

### Day 7: February 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
- I've created an auth HoC for protected pages
- i've moved the note creation process to it's respective route

**Thoughts**: Despite it being a hard day, i've found a few moments to spare, but to be honest, I'm not really happy with my progress

### Day 6: February 12, 2023

**Today's progress**:
- I've created a simple form with some input. very nice

**Thoughts**:
Working with t3 is like a bliss.

### Day 5: February 10, 2023

I love notion, but it's missing some features I'd really love to have. All the open source note taking and project management apps suck in a way, so this will be my attempt to make something that actually doesn't suck, within the boundaries of this challenge

**Today's Progress**:
- I checked out the create t3 app with all it's featues
- I added the email auth provider 

**Thoughts**:
Setting up a project seems always way easier than it actually is, and the issues are usually not with the framework but all the services...

### Day 4: February 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
- I've accomplished the hardest task I put content on a website I created. It's way more about the content.
- I learned about the `marker:` selector in Tailwind too. üëç

**Thoughts**: Writing content is hard. For me it's the hardest part, and I'm glad to finally be over it.
Also, I'm not too fond of Qwik. It's a bit barebones and lacks many convenience features. Also there's an issue with the SSR part which looks like a bug, but i didn't put the effort in to validate. Dunno. It's nice for FFFFFAST sites, but I wouldn't use it for apps. Had better experience with sveltekit

### Day 3: February 8, 2023

I did code, but I didn't summarize fuck it! This is fine

### Day 2: February 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
- created pages and navigation
- read Qwik's documentation back and forth

**Thoughts**: this challenge is way more challanging than I anticipated in the beginning. The real issue is that I have no real goal with the website. It's not like this would be the first one I'm working on, but well, what do I put on it? This is much more a content situation, rather than a programming one.
Qwik is awesome, but it lacks a few things that should be trivial. For example: Links have no active state ...

### Day 1: February 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
- created a logo
- binged dribble for inspiration

### Day 0: February 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- created a vercel project for [ruf.gg](https://ruf.gg)
- updated nameservers for ruf.gg
- created github repo for the website
- initiated a qwik project and did some RTFM
- created a very basic site using qwik, set up deployment and deployed the site on vercel

**Thoughts:** It took me way more time to set up the entire thing than anticipated, it took approx. an hour to get to the point I am at now. I've never done this and had to read docs. Also, I procrastinated a bit in the beginning, so based on my tracker it took me way more than an hour, but I can't count browsing dribble for design ideas :D

Deploying stuff on vercel is SMOOOOOTH. Recommended!
