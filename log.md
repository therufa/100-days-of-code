# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- created a vercel project for (ruf.gg)[https://ruf.gg]
- updated nameservers for ruf.gg
- created github repo for the website
- initiated a qwik project and did some RTFM
- created a very basic site using qwik, set up deployment and deployed the site on vercel

**Thougs:** It took me way more time to set up the entire thing than anticipated, it took approx. an hour to get to the point I am at now. I've never done this and had to read docs. Also, I procrastinated a bit in the beginning, so based on my tracker it took me way more than an hour, but I can't count browsing dribble for design ideas :D

Deploying stuff on vercel is SMOOOOOTH. Recommended!
