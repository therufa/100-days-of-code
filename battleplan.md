# 100 Days Of Code - Battleplans

I want to create a few websites in the near future. One for each business endeavour I operate, and one personal one... like a portfolio.

The websites should load as quick as possible, therefore I decided to give [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) a try.
Obviously the for styling I'll use tailwind, and for the themes.. well, I might pull off a Picasso move.
